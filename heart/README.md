# ❤️ Heart Simulator

An interactive step-by-step visualization of how the human heart works.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- The path of blood through the four chambers of the heart
- How heart valves work (tricuspid, mitral, pulmonary, aortic)
- The difference between venous blood (blue) and arterial blood (red)
- The role of the lungs in blood oxygenation
- Systole and diastole: contraction and relaxation phases

## 📖 The 7 Steps

| Step | Phase | What happens |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Venous return | Blood returns from the body to the right atrium |
| 2 | Right filling | Tricuspid valve opens, blood enters right ventricle |
| 3 | To the lungs | Right ventricle pumps blood through pulmonary artery |
| 4 | Oxygenation | Gas exchange in the lungs (blue → red) |
| 5 | Left filling | Oxygenated blood fills the left atrium |
| 6 | Left transfer | Mitral valve opens, blood enters left ventricle |
| 7 | To the body | Left ventricle pumps blood through aorta to all organs |
