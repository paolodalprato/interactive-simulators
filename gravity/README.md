# 2D Gravity Simulator

An interactive simulator to explore gravitational attraction between particles and observe the formation of complex structures from simple rules.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This simulator helps you understand:

- Newton's law of universal gravitation (F = G·m₁·m₂/r²)
- How complex behaviors emerge from simple rules
- Conservation of momentum in collisions
- The effect of the gravitational constant on system dynamics

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Adjust initial parameters**: number of particles, initial velocity, gravitational constant G
2. **Press "Start"**: observe particles attracting and merging
3. **Experiment**: change G during simulation to see immediate effects
4. **Press "Reset"**: restart with new conditions

### Try These Scenarios

**Rapid cluster formation**:

- G = 300-400
- Particles = 100-150
- Initial velocity = 0.5

**Slow aggregation**:

- G = 20-30
- Particles = 50
- Initial velocity = 1.0

**Few trackable particles**:

- G = 100
- Particles = 20-30
- Initial velocity = 0.3

## 🔬 Key Features

- **Realistic physics**: accurate implementation of universal gravitation law
- **Mass visualization**: colors ranging from red (small mass) to violet (large mass)
- **Momentum conservation**: collisions respect physical laws
- **Emergent behavior**: complex structures emerge spontaneously
- **Adjustable parameters**: full control over particle count, velocity, and gravity
- **Bilingual**: available in Italian and English

## 📚 Educational Context

**Target audience**: High school and university students, physics enthusiasts, teachers

**Prerequisites**: Basic physics knowledge (forces, mass, velocity)

**Use cases**:

- Physics classroom demonstrations
- Self-learning about gravitation
- Exploring emergent behavior in physical systems
- Visualizing abstract physics concepts

**Concepts demonstrated**:

- Universal gravitation law (F ∝ m₁·m₂/r²)
- Distance dependence of force (inverse square law)
- Conservation of mass and momentum
- Emergent behavior in complex systems
- Structure formation through gravitational self-aggregation

**Common misconceptions addressed**:

- "Gravity acts instantaneously" → no, but at this scale the difference is imperceptible
- "Huge masses are needed for visible gravitational effects" → it depends on scale and constant G
- "Cosmic collisions are explosive" → they're often mergers that conserve momentum
