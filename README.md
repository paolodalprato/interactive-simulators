# 🎓 Interactive Educational Simulators

A collection of interactive simulators designed to explain complex concepts through visual and engaging interaction.

**Note**: These are qualitative simulations created for educational purposes. They demonstrate core principles using simplified models and exaggerated parameters to make concepts visible and understandable at human timescales.

## 🎯 Goal

Make learning more accessible through interactive visualizations that allow you to explore step-by-step how complex systems work.
